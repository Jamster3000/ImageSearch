###In progress

This is a desktop application using c# programming language and asp.net along with windows forms. 
This is to search for images by a database of keywords. It also has an option to add to images and keywords linked to each one and preview the selected image before saving it to the database.
It uses SQLite database rather than the original idea of using a csv file.

To run this you will have to compile the code files first (https://github.com/Jamster3000/ImageSearch/tree/master/DNDImageSearch). There will be an executabe for this later along the line.

For a more detailed usage of the app see the wiki (https://github.com/Jamster3000/ImageSearch/wiki)
