This is a desktop application using c# programming language along with windows forms. 
This is to search for images by a database of keywords. It also has an option to add to images and keywords linked to each one and preview the selected image before saving it to the database.
It uses SQLite database rather than the original idea of using a csv file.

in addition to this you can now also add an optional image url for IF your image is hosted somewhere. This is optional to add and can be changed on each individual image.
## usage
To use this program take a look at the first release (for windows). Just download the exe file and execute.
[https://github.com/Jamster3000/ImageSearch/releases/tag/v2.0.0](https://github.com/Jamster3000/ImageSearch/releases/tag/v2.0.0)

To upgrade to a newer version download the new version. In your old version look for the information files that came with it. Save the "ImageLibrary" file. Once the new version is ready for use, replace the "ImageLibrary" file that came with the download with the "ImageLibrary" that you copied. This will ensure that the data you have saved to the database already will remain in the new version. Please be aware that any modifications to the database in newer version may result in incompatability.
