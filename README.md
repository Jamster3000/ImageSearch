This is a desktop application using c# programming language and asp.net along with windows forms. 

This is to search for images by a database of keywords. It also has an option to add to images and keywords linked to each one and preview the selected image before saving it to the database.

It uses SQLite database rather than the original idea of using a csv file.


##todo list##

) Find and add the suitable colours for the app making it look more pleasent rather than just the wire frame of it.

) Create a suitable icon/logo for the app.

) make sure that the resized version of the window still looks suitable after resizing.
